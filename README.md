This is is a front-end tool, using the LTI (Learning Tools Interoperability) Protocol, which is a standard developed by the IMS Global Learning Consortium. LTI allows for seamless integration of externally hosted web-based learning tools into Learning Management Systems (LMS) such as Moodle and Sakai. This project uses React, Bootstrap 5 and Next.js.

## Getting Started

- [Install NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Install Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)

Install necessary dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

(Dummy) API routes can be accessed on http://localhost:3000/api/hello. This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as API routes instead of React pages.
